# AQI Overview Dashboard (2017–2020)

## Overview
This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data across major Indian cities to identify pollution patterns, compare cities, and track air quality trends over time. The dashboard transforms raw environmental data into clear, interactive visuals using Power BI.

---

## Problem Statement
Air quality data is often available in large, unstructured datasets, making it difficult to:
- Compare pollution levels across cities
- Identify highly polluted and least polluted regions
- Track AQI trends over multiple years
- Understand the impact of major pollutants

This project addresses these challenges by presenting all key AQI insights in a single interactive dashboard.

---

## Key KPIs
- Average AQI by city and year  
- Top 3 most polluted cities  
- Top 3 least polluted cities  
- Average pollutant levels:
  - CO (Carbon Monoxide)
  - PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)
  - SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)
  - NO (Nitric Oxide)
- Year-wise AQI trend (2015–2020)

---

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive city-level slicers
- KPI cards for pollutant averages
- Bar charts for most and least polluted cities
- Line chart showing AQI trends over time
- Map visualization for geographic AQI comparison

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)
- DAX (measures and KPIs)
- Power BI Map Visual

---

## Key Learnings
- Designing dashboards around real analytical questions
- Defining meaningful KPIs instead of visual overload
- Improving usability with filters and geographic views
